  - title: Arts
    description: "The arts play a central role in empowering self-expression,
      celebrating our humanity, and inspiring our society to think in new ways.
      In a world that is increasingly focused on metrics, we seek to create a
      space for things that are harder to measure: imagination, creativity, and
      innovation."

        organization_description: “I was completely taken aback by the scale of Roden
          Crater, the sheer ambition of the work, and the long-term vision that
          drives James. Roden Crater is art, but it is also an exploration of
          space, light, time, and so much more. One simply must experience it. I
          am certain that the Roden Crater will inspire humanity for centuries
          to come.”

        organization_description: “Frank and Malissa have created something amazing with
          Turnaround Arts, bringing art to low-performing schools across
          California and inspiring young people to think creatively. Turnaround
          Arts has demonstrated that their arts education programs can lead to
          improvements in academic achievement, increases in attendance, and
          reduction in disciplinary referrals. Behold the power of creativity!”

        organization_description: “Crossroads School for Arts & Sciences is
          one-of-a-kind, and I am so grateful that I had the opportunity to
          attend for thirteen years. Crossroads gave me the opportunity to
          pursue my passions from a young age and challenged me to see the world
          from many different perspectives.”

        organization_title: Episcopal School of Los Angeles
        organization_description: “I feel fortunate to have met Maryetta Anschutz, the
          founder of the Episcopal School of Los Angeles when I was in high
          school. She had a dream of building a private school in Los Angeles
          that would serve a diverse population of students with an education
          rooted in generosity, integrity, curiosity, and courage. Starting a
          school isn’t easy, and I have learned so much watching ESLA grow into
          the amazing institution that it is today!”
